NAS IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS AND TECHNICAL METHODS (NAS_2)
Technical Architecture and Hardware-Aware Implementation: Utilises a modular SearchSpace dataclass that defines hyperparameter ranges across embedding dimensions (256-1024), attention heads(4-16), layer depths (6-24), and architectural variants including informer, linear, performer and standard attention mechanisms. The HardwareProfiler class implements crucial constraints largely by estimating memory usage via parameter counting and activation memory calculations, while latency estimation incorporates hardware-specific compute capability scaling for GPUs with different architectures.
Configurable transformer implementation features pluggable attention modules supporting multiple attention types with different computational complexities - Linear attention using ReLU feature maps for O(n) complexity, informer with learned projections for sequence length reduction, and performer style random feature approximations. Memory management techniques include gradient checkpointing considerations through modular block design, and the system maintains compatibility constraints, such as ensuring embedding dimensions are divisible by attention heads throughout the evolutionary process. 

ML Optimisation Methods and Search Strategies: Integrates evolutionary algorithms with progressive search strategies and multi-objective optimisation techniques specifically tailored for transformer architectures. The EvolutionarySearcher implements tournament selection with elite preservation, maintaining population diversity via configurable mutation rates (0.3) and crossover operations (0.6) that respect architectural constraints.
The progressive search strategy employs curriculum learning by gradually expanding the search space across multiple stages, starting with smaller model configurations and incrementally increasing complexity, a technique geared towards improving convergence efficiency and preventing premature optimisation of oversized architectures.
PerformancePredictor implements a multi-objective scoring system combining efficiency scores (normalised memory usage and latency), capacity scores (layer depth, embedding dimension, and FFN ratio), and diversity bonuses for non-standard configurations. Architectures are scored based on their ability to fit within GPU memory constraints and meet latency requirements, with performance caching to avoid redundant evaluations.
The process maintains architectural validity via constraint enforcement during mutation and crossover operations, ensuring that generated architectures remain trainable and deployable.
